# 2025_1_BasicProjectLab_Barta

## Project Overview  
`2025_1_BasicProjectLab_Barta` is a project developed as part of the Basic Project Lab course in the Department of Artificial Intelligence during the first semester of 2025.  
The goal of this project is to follow the design thinking process, applying domain knowledge and technical skills to identify users, discover their needs, define key problems, and develop effective solutions.  
The project focuses on building stable and functional software using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, along with various modules and libraries.

We developed a voice-controlled video navigation service for beginner cooks called **"Barta."** This service is designed to address the inconveniences commonly experienced when using video-based cooking content. It implements user-centered features such as section-based video navigation, step-by-step cooking summaries, voice command support, and customized timers. These functionalities enable users to follow recipes efficiently, even when their hands are not free during cooking.
